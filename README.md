# GetPassword

PURPOSE
A password generator is a common feature of password managers and even many modern browsers. When combined with a password manager, the random strings these programs produce offer a high level of security against brute force attacks even when the method of generation is known by the attacker. This purpose of this program is to generate passwords with a quality that is comparable to the aforementioned conventional password generators. Since GetPassword is a custom implementation, it has the added benefit of creating passwords that are extra secure against attackers who havenâ€™t read this repository :)

METHOD
GetPassword uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator as supplied by the SecureRandom class. Specifically, the program uses the SHA1PRNG algorithm as provided by Sun.
